## Installation

### instantOS is still in early beta, contributions always welcome

## Features

instantLOCK is a fork of [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/) with some added features that make it more usable to a "normal" computer user
The added features include

- Dot indicators when typing the password
- A warning message if someone tried (and failed) to unlock the screen
- Option to unlock screen without a password
- ilock wrapper
- Dad jokes

Some features are also based on suckless patches and work pretty much the same

- Message
- Xresources
- Ctrl + U to clear
